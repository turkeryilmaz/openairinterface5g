# Overview

This implements a shared memory realtime and near-realtime radio interface.
This is performed using `shm_td_iq_channel` which handles the shared memory
interface.

# Architecture

The `vrtsim` architecture follows a server-client model:

- **Server (gNB)**: On startup, the server writes a file, default location is
  `/tmp/vrtsim_connection`. This file contains information required by the client
  to establish communication.
- **Client (UE)**: The client reads this file from, verifies its contents, and uses
  the provided information to open and connect to the shared memory channel.
- **Shared Memory Channel**: Both server and client use the `shm_td_iq_channel` to
  exchange IQ samples and control data in real time or near-real time.

## Channel modelling:


# Limitations

 - Only 1gNB to 1nrUE: gNB as a server, UE as a client.

# Usage

On the UE and gNB: use `device.name vrtsim` command line argument.

Additionally on gNB use `vrtsim.role server` and optionally
`vrtsim.timescale <timescale>` to set the timescale. Timescale 1.0
is the default and means realtime.

Channel modelling can be enabled by adding `vrtsim.chanmod 1` to the
command line and should work the same as channel modelling in rfsimulator,
see rfsimulator [documentation](../rfsimulator/README.md) with a slight difference:
channel modelling is done on transmission instead of reception. To refect this,
the model names are slightly different: the server expects a model named
`server_tx_channel_model` while the client expects a model named `client_tx_channel_model`

Additionally, `taps_client` is available in vrtsim. This allows to connect to
channel emulation server and receive external taps (or channel impulse responses).
To use external taps, use `--taps-socket` and provide a nanomsg PUB socket address
that will publish the taps.

# Debugging

## Realtime issues

Realtime issues can prevent the UE from connecting to the gNB, especially with
channel modelling enabled. Consider adjusting `timescale` parameter until
the UE can connect reliably.

On exit, vrtsim will output a histogram of the measured transmission budget, which
is defined as the number of microseconds before the transmitted samples could be
read by peer.

Samples in bin 0 indicate realtime issues.
