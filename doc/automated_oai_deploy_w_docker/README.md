# Information about the environment used

* Kernel version
  * Before installing other packages, install the indicated kernel. After installation, perform a reboot.
  * Installation command: `sudo apt install linux-image-5.15.0-89-lowlatency -y`
  * After the reboot, make sure that the installed kernel has been loaded with the `uname -a` command.

* Host used: Lenovo SR630 - 64bit x84 architecture
  * **Processor:** Intel Xeon Gold 5218R
  * **RAM:** 128GB DDR4 (4x 32GB) - Dual Channel
  * **HDD:** 10TB
  * **Operating System:** Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS (Fresh install)
  * **Ettus driver:** version v4.4.0.0

* USRP Ettus N310
  * Ettus driver: version v4.4.0.0

# Environment installation
## Step 1: Clone this Repository
After installing the indicated `Kernel` on a clean installation of Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS, perform the following procedures:

Clone the OAI repository on your Linux system:
```
git clone https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g.git ~/openairinterface5g

cd ~/openairinterface5g/doc/automated_oai_deploy_w_docker
```

## Step 2: Install Docker and Ettus driver
Run the `./oai_5g_core_install.sh` script. It will be responsible for installing Docker and the necessary OpenAirInterface resources. Do not use `sudo` to execute the script, but the user must have permission to use the `sudo` command (which is present when executing the script's internal commands).

```bash
./oai_5g_core_install.sh
```


# Using the environment
## Step 1: Initializing 5GC
To initialize the core services you must use the `core-start.sh` script.

```bash
./core-start.sh
```

## Step 2: Run the gNodeB Docker container
Make sure that the USRP (Ettus N310 or Ettus B210) is connected **directly** to the host machine.
* Ettus N310: Make sure that the IP address of the USRP communication interface is correctly indicated in the configuration files (from the `conf` directory, the `addr` parameter of the `sdr_addrs` property);
* Ettus B210: Make sure it is connected to the host via a USB3 port or higher.

To initialize the container, run the following command:
```bash
./services.sh [parameter]
```

Available parameters:
- `n106` to use PRB = 106 on USRP N310
- `n162` to use PRB = 162 in USRP N310
- `n273` to use PRB = 273 in USRP N310
- `b106` to use PRB = 106 in USRP B210
- `b162` to use PRB = 162 in USRP B210
- `stop` to end the containers

Example: `./services.sh n106`

This will run a shell script that will start a container with the settings mentioned above.


## Stopping 5GC services
To stop core services you must use the `core-stop.sh` script.

```bash
./core-stop.sh
```

# How to configure
* [USRP Ettus N310](docs/conf-n310/README-usrp-n310.md)
* [Performance Mode](docs/conf-performance/README.md)
* [Configure SIMCard](docs/conf-simcard/README.md)
* [UE Motorola G50](docs/conf-Motorola-G50/README.md)

# Troubleshooting

In this section, we discuss common issues encountered during the setup and deployment phases of the OAI 5G network and provide solutions. 

* Docker Container Failures:
   - **Issue**: Containers fail to start due to missing dependencies.
   - **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the containers. Use the command `docker logs [container_id]` to get detailed error messages. 

* USRP Connection Problems:
   - **Issue**: USRP device not recognized by the host machine.
   - **Solution**: Verify the USRP is properly connected and the correct IP address is configured. Use the command `uhd_find_devices` to detect connected USRP devices.

* Network Configuration Errors:
   - **Issue**: No communication between gNB and 5GC.
   - **Solution**: Check IP forwarding and iptables settings. Ensure that the gNB configuration file has the correct IP addresses for the 5GC components.

* Signal Quality Issues:
   - **Issue**: Poor signal quality or no signal detected.
   - **Solution**: Verify antenna connections and ensure they are properly placed. Adjust the transmission power settings in the configuration file.
    
* Performance Bottlenecks:
   - **Issue**: Suboptimal throughput performance.
   - **Solution**: Monitor CPU and memory usage to identify bottlenecks. Adjust the configuration parameters such as `nb_tx`, `nb_rx`, and `max_rxgain` to optimize performance.
