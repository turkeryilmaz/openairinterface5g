/**
 * ShmTdIqChannel is a shared memory bidirectional time domain IQ channel with a single clock
 * source. The server (clock source) shall create the channel while the client should connect to
 * it.
 *
 * To write samples, send them via a pointer passed to shm_td_iq_channel_tx.
 * To read samples, receive them via a pointer passed to shm_td_iq_channel_rx. You can either wait until
 * the sample are available using shm_td_iq_channel_wait or poll using shm_td_iq_channel_rx until the return
 * value is not CHANNEL_ERROR_TOO_EARLY.
 * To indicate that samples are ready to be read by the client, call shm_td_iq_channel_produce_samples
 * (server only).
 *
 * The timestamps used in the API are in absolute samples from the time the client/server connection started.
